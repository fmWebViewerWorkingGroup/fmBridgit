# fullcalendar

This fullcalendar example does not aim to be a full fledged application, but tries to document what the fmBridgit module actually does.

For your convenience, the example file works with the support files already hosted on the Dutch FileMaker forum https://www.clarify.net.

By switching to the "local" layout, a version of the support files is copied into an $$_html global variable, and the example file can be used without any internet connection.

The scripts are documented as much as possible, to give you an idea how to implement fmBridgit in your own FileMaker solutions.
