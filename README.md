# fmBridgit

fmBridgit is the combination of a FileMaker module and a JavaScript library file, that makes it easier to:
1. perform a script in a WebViewer object on the layout of a FileMaker solution.
2. wait for the result of this script
3. perform a FileMaker script from your own JavaScript code in a WebViewer object in FileMaker
4. wait for the result of this script call

fmBridgit aims to be a simple, comprehensive and and portable framework.
It is a work in progress though, as it started out as forum discussions on https://clarify.net, Slack and Riot, and Jitsi video chats related to the https://dotfmp.berlin 2020 event.
It would never have been possible without prior work done in the community ( jquery, moment, and the JavaScript Promise examples by Andries which he did for https://www.1-more-thing.com a few years ago ).
